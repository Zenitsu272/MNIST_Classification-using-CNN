# MNIST_Classification-using-CNN
This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0â€“9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into 60,000 training and 10,000 test images, making it a standard benchmark for image classification tasks. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built to perform multiclass classification on this dataset.
The neural network consists of 2 convolutional layers and 2 pooling layers.
The convolutional layer has 16 and 32 filters each with a kernel size/filter dimension as 2x2 with reLU activation to avoid the vanishing gradient problem.
This layer had different strides in both layers (2x2 and 1x1).
The pooling layers had similar filter/pooling sizes and strides as 2x2 in both layers.
Then the output was flattened and a dense layer was added with 100 nodes and reLU as activation function.
Finally, at the output end, softmax activation was used with an output layer to classify the outputs .
RESULTS : Obtained over 98.35% accuracy in only 10 epochs 
Optimizer : Adam , loss : categorical_crossentropy
Thank You! Stay tuned for exciting projects.
